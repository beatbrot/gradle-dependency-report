## Contribution Guidelines

**1)**  The best way to contribute is taking a look at the currently open [issues](https://github.com/beatbrot/gradle-dependency-report/issues) and provide some help, or creating a new one pointing out bugs (make sure to provide enough information to make the bug reproducible) and suggesting missing or wanted features. 

**2)**  If you want to directly contribute to the project adding a feature, please create an issue describing the feature before creating a pull request. This plugin is simple and lean by default. We'll probably never reach feature parity with ben-manes [versions-plugin](https://github.com/ben-manes/gradle-versions-plugin). Our main goal is compatibility and reliability.

**3)**  Of course, you can also tell your friends about **gradle-dependency-report**, use it at your company or write a (positive) review of it somewhere on the internet.

**4)**  Buy me a beer or [become a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/beatbrot).
